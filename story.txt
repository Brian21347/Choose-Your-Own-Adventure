{#hear broadcast
- A pop song plays on the radio but suddenly crackles out. A voice, clearly distressed, speaks through a broadcast cutting in and out. "United States Department of Homeland Security Report 7a, March 30th of this year: Project Rebirth containment efforts have failed. Deployment in Country Z is delayed. Infected persons span zone theta. Contaminated areas are to be sealed with Level 4 contamination measures. Rebirth experts report great success in the effectiveness of Rebirth Strand 3511 within the infected territory -- too successful.  Area Theta is under martial law and all civilians should be shot on sight." Someone says, "The government is lying to us! If you want to live, make it to - {static}." "Sorry about that, y'all," the broadcaster says nonchalantly, "it seems April Fool's pranksters are skilled in the art of radio hacking nowadays."

Your vision fades, and just as everything is turning black, you hear your dad also starting to cough...

{#door opens
- Your best friend Miller stands there, his eyes screaming in panic, his body drenched from sweat and his chest rising and falling up and down with each enervated breath. He lunges forward, grabs your shirt (very out of character), and says, "Let me in. Now."After you let him in and get him something to drink, and tell you about the virus. "It's like nothing else that humans have ever encountered," he says. "It kills almost anyone that it infects and is very contagious" He continues to explain how his dad had come home sick last night while he was asleep. He said he remembers hearing him coughing violently in the middle of the night. Now he knows why. "You're the only person I can trust right now. We need to get out of here and get somewhere safe" Miller says.

- You make it into the safe haven with Miller without either of you getting sick. The safe haven stops accepting people an hour after you get inside because it gets too full of people.

{#cough cough
- Someone coughs behind you. 5 minutes later, you start feeling lightheaded and developing a scratchy throat. What seems to be hours later, you start coughing, and your vision starts blurring. You start slipping in and out of consciousness as everyone in and around the "safe haven" starts coughing as well. Miller falls near you, and you can barely make out Miller trying to say something. You try responding, but you're too weak. Finally, you succumb to the disease, just as the sky is drowned in flame...

Ending:
{#mission report
- {United States Department of Homeland Security Report 7b}: The first bioweapon attack seems to have taken place in Zone Psi. The disease is too deadly and must be contained. Unfortunately, the only feasible method is incinerating all inhabitants of the zone. Project Rebirth will move forward to allow counter attack.
